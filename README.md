# 🖥️ Activate macOS Overlay

A macOS parody overlay that mimics the classic "Activate Windows" watermark — but for macOS.

This lightweight Swift app displays a subtle floating message in the bottom-right corner of your screen:

> Activate macOS  
> Go to System Settings to activate macOS.

Useful for memes, screenshots, pranks, or custom setups.
